David Hunt will finally be available on Wednesday to work with Kay to address legal issues. Bob Priest is recommending Enron to his board tonight. Due to their peaker deal with Aquilla, they have been unable to make progress on our LOI, so it will not be presented at his board meeting Tuesday night. He has them on notice that special meeting may be called to execute the LOI as early as a week from today. He would like to be in agreement on the LOI issues by the end of this week. He has the following comments on the LOI: ? page 4 paragraph 8, ""negotiate"" rather than ""negotiates"" ? we need clarification on the mechanism by which Enron will recover infrastructure costs. He wants to make sure that Enron cost recovery is out of our 40% and backed up by a guaranteed monthly minimum calculated as the amoritized capital costs over the contract period. ? he wants more detail on the $50k breakup fee. What are the circumstances that would precipitate a payout? ? David Hunt and Kay Mann need to get together (he indicated that David has been unavailable) to address the legal issues including limitation of liability and arbitration such that they agree with Mississippi law. ? he needs some specifics on the ancilliary services (load following, regualtion, and reserves). On the last issue, he indicated that this is the ""deal maker/breaker."" He offered that our competition indicated that their regulated side would be providing those services. He needs to know from Enron who we would contract with to do it--""we can horse trade on the price later."" I indicated that we have not given specifics to the market in searching for ancilliary services, and were waiting on the LOI before we asked for proposals. He wants specifics--other than pricing--before he signs the LOI. After talking with Ozzie and Lloyd, here is the game plan: ? get the Entergy tariff and price the ancilliary services with Entergy as the provider ? find out who the high-load-factor IPPs are in the Mississippi area ? put calls in to those IPPs as well as CLECO, LEPA, SMEPA, Cajun, Alabama Electric Power Co-op, and Entergy and guage interest and potential pricing for providing ancilliary services ? we will need approximately 4 MW of regulation service, load following and reserves. We would send the signal and communicate with the ancilliary service provider. ? Once we have gathered some preliminary information, call Marvin on Wednesday and let him know that we expect to go with Entergy during the first 60 days beginning May 1 and select/negotiate/contract with one of the above for the balance of the contract. In no case would the pricing be higher than the entergy tariff rates. I would like to have Christi and Lloyd available for the call to Marvin. How does all this sound?? "

How are we setting the heat rate? Do we have the GADS (?)? Is it a daily average, weekly average? Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often? [Fairley, David] Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model. As conditions change the utilities must update this info. We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage. Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability. No GADS. Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps.. 2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions? [Fairley, David] Yes, their units are too small. We have discussed this with the customer, and with our internal air permit guys. [Rorschach, Reagan] They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to us today. They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are limited on oil. Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible. 3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right? [Fairley, David] We won't buy and sell fuel oil. We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split. [Rorschach, Reagan] We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies. 4. We aren't making money on gas, right? [Fairley, David] We make money on gas two ways. The first is outside the contract, and is basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities. The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade, and those procedures apply. 5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture? [Fairley, David] Yes, will send separately. 6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits? [Fairley, David] The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of Asset Management have been upated. The other Exhibits have not been modified. The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their comments/questions incorporated. 7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae: The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on. [Fairley, David] Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties. Will look at it again. Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough. [Rorschach, Reagan] See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example. Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? [Fairley, David] There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances? Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement. EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances. Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties. A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure. How are we setting the bogey? Formula? [Fairley, David] The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day. Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the day's activities. [Rorschach, Reagan] Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit? [Fairley, David] Yes, but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day. Frankly, they would like to have less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day. Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)? [Fairley, David] One bogey for power. Gas is an input for determining the bogey. [Rorschach, Reagan] Bogey set day-ahead. What is defn of profit? I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check. [Fairley, David] This is in the pricing calc's. Should we have a definition? What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David] see cost definition being provided separately. Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. [Fairley, David] See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. [Fairley, David] Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem. What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits? Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power? [Rorschach, Reagan] I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly. We need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports. It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around. Thanks, Kay "

Need details re item 1 below. Please suggest language (band of acceptability, etc) which I will massage and incorporate. [Rorschach, Reagan] Heat rates for given output from each machine are incorporated in the bogey model. We will establish these for contract purposes in the exhibit that specs out all owned assets. Those are the rates that we will discuss/modify each quarter. [Fairley, David] Even though tweaking heat rates in the stack model periodically (at least to be discussed quarterly) is subjective, MDEA would always want to be as accurate as possible because the the inaccuracy causes the incorrect quantity of gas to be nominated, so they underburn or overburn for the day, which would get expensive if the extent of the inaccuracy were very much. They wear the risk on this. Being short or long delivered gas presents a variety of ways in which MDEA has to pay for costs to get in balance. Therefore, any desire that they might have to improperly shift the ""bogey"" to pay us $2 - 4 less per MWh, costs them more in gas imbalance costs. 6. Do I have the latest draft of Marketing/Risk policies? [Rorschach, Reagan] Yes [Fairley, David] Sent via e-mail 5-21, but will re-send that e-mail for convenience. 7. Bogey calc only addresses gas. What if the fuel of choice is fuel oil? Does the fuel cost and heat rate change? [Rorschach, Reagan] heat rates change when switching to fuel oil. That info is not available from MDEA. If the opportunity presents itself, we will evaluate on a event specific basis and agree to the actual cost of production. [Fairley, David] The rule of thumb that we will use to look at the Stack Model when burning oil vs. gas is about a 5% improvement in heat rate with oil. Cost per MMBtu is whatever we plug into the model, whether gas or oil, and prices change daily and intraday anyway, so price changes don't bother us. Since the oil is coming out of their tank, there is no concern about gas imbalance cost, therefore agonizing very much about heat rate modifications when using oil vs. gas is not really very practical. Please point me to the defn of profit by cutting and pasting from wherever it is. I did a quick search and couldn't find it, but I didn't do a page turn to locate it. [Fairley, David] It is in the last exhibit, MDEA EPMI Incentive Fee Calculation, Exhibit XX, attached. I'm not sure that Section 13 and Exhibit XX work well together. They were drafted at different times. I will send any comments on this in the morning. (The only thing that we have changed in this group of exhibits attached is the revised asset management services description that was e-mailed with the Marketing Strat. and the Trad & Risk Policy).

I haven't worked on them, but I suspect the exhibits need work. I know the bogey calc doc is a bit rough. [Rorschach, Reagan] Exhibits are rough. I need to make a list of Exhibits called out in the current doc version, pull them all together, and clean them up. Do you still owe me the emergency transmission cut stuff? [Rorschach, Reagan] Yes. I am not exactly sure of the context....but try this on for size: Clarksdale is subject to an Entergy transmission constraint that from time to time results in a transmission cut and mandates Clarksdale dispatching their generation assets to serve Clarksdale Native Load. Dispatching Clarksdale assets under these circumstances is known as the first contingency must run condition. During first contingency must run conditions, EPMI will document the production costs, megawatts generated, duration of the event, and lost opportunity cost of buying from the market. Clarksdale is due reimbursement from Entergy for extra costs incurred during such events. Early next week is better than later, and Thursday and Friday are huge problem days for me.

They liked the strategy of going with Entergy (although they were nervous about some of the people we might have to deal with) and looking at other alternatives. Initially our empahsis is to get them up and running without delay. Any other plan would not be prudent. They would like to have the LOI reference our plan to provide the ancilliary services. Not play attorney again but....can we add some language like the following: Ancilliary Services: EPMI would arrange for The cities to contract for ancilliary services with Entergy in accordance with the Entergy tariff for an interim period beginning May 1, 2001. During that interim period, EPMI would solicit ancilliary proposals from other control areas, as feasible. If an alternate to Entergy is identified, EPMI may recommend that The Cities contract with the alternate for the balance of the EPMI term. Christi has reservations about this maybe not having enough wiggle room for us, and I agree. There are a few other places in the LOI we will need to reference the ancilliary management responsibility EPMI is contemplating. Also, I think this creates a need to have a definition of ancilliary services in the LOI. We have a meeting scheduled with Entergy for Tuesday morning to discuss Enron buying ancilliary services.

Contracts by members to buy power from joint agencies Current through End of 2000 3rd Ex. Sess. References Any municipality which is a member of the joint agency may contract to buy from the joint agency power and energy required for its present or future requirements, including the capacity and output of one or more specified projects. As the creation of a joint agency is an alternative method whereby a municipality may obtain the benefits and assume the responsibilities of ownership in a project, any such contract may provide that the municipality so contracting shall be obligated to make the payments required by the contract whether or not a project is completed, operable, operating, retired or decommissioned and notwithstanding the suspension, interruption, interference, reduction, curtailment or termination of the output of a project or the power and energy contracted for, and that such payments under the contract shall not be subject to any reduction whether by offset or otherwise, and shall not be conditioned upon the performance or nonperformance of the joint agency or any other member of the joint agency under the contract or any other instrument. Any contract with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity or output of a project entered into between a joint agency and its member municipalities may also provide that if one or more of such municipalities shall default in the payment of its or their obligations, with respect to the purchase of said capacity or output, then in that event the remaining member municipalities which are purchasing capacity and output under the contract shall be required to accept and pay for and shall be entitled proportionately to and may use or otherwise dispose of the capacity or output which was to be purchased by the defaulting municipality. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, any such contracts with respect to the sale or purchase of capacity, output, power or energy from a project may extend for a period not exceeding fifty (50) years from the date a project is estimated to be placed in normal continuous operation; and the execution and effectiveness thereof shall not be subject to any authorizations or approvals by the state or any agency, commission or instrumentality or political subdivision thereof except as in this article specifically required and provided. Payments by a municipality under any contract for the purchase of capacity and output from a joint agency shall be made solely from the revenues derived from the ownership and operation of the electric system of said municipality and any obligation under such contract shall not constitute a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any property of the municipality or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues, except the revenues of its electric system, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the municipality are, or may be, pledged for the payment of any obligation under any such contract. A municipality shall be obligated to fix, charge and collect rents, rates, fees and charges for electric power and energy and other services, facilities and commodities, sold, furnished or supplied through its electric system sufficient to provide revenues adequate to meet its obligations under any such contract and to pay any and all other amounts payable from or constituting a charge and lien upon such revenues, including amounts sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on bonds heretofore or hereafter issued by the municipality for purposes related to its electric system. Any municipality which is a member of a joint agency may furnish the joint agency with money derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or facilities and may make available for the use of the joint agency any personnel, equipment and property, both real and personal, which is a part of its electric system or facilities. Any member of a joint agency may contract for, advance or contribute funds derived solely from the ownership and operation of its electric system or facilities to a joint agency as may be agreed upon by the joint agency and the member, and the joint agency shall repay such advances or contributions from proceeds of bonds, from operating revenues or from any other funds of the joint agency, together with interest thereon as may be agreed upon by the member and the joint agency.

Unless I have some misunderstanding, it seems to me that in a Back-to-Back Transaction you could easily have a situation in which EPMI is making a profit from a transaction on which the Cities are losing money.? The ""Savings per hour"" on which EPMI's profit sharing is based is only the difference between the Market Price (what the purchaser agreed to pay) and the Cities' Target Production Cost (incremental fuel cost and variable O&M).? The ""Savings per hour"" ignores all of the other costs that the Cities may be obligated to pay under a Back-to-Back Transaction such as transmission, ancillary service, imbalance, congestion, etc. (see the definition of Costs below).? For example, if the Target Production cost is $40/MWh, the Market Price $43/MWh, and transmission is $4/MWh, the Cities would be paying EPMI a profit sharing incentive fee of $1.20/MWh, while losing $2.20/MWh on the sale transaction.? As I have noted before, the ""Savings"" on a transaction should be as follows: Savings = Revenues from the Transaction - Production Cost (base on the Target Production Cost and MWhs) - Costs associated with the Transaction incurred by EPMI or the Cities (where Costs include the items defined in Article 1 of the EMSA) We will get back to you later with comments on the other documents. - - Al Definition of Costs in the ESMA: ""Costs"" means, when applicable to any Transaction, all costs, liabilities, fees and expenses? incurred by EPMI (excluding EPMI's internal costs and allocated overhead) in connection with the purchase, sale, replacement, scheduling, transmission and delivery of Products and balancing services, entered into between MDEA, EPMI, and third parties. Costs shall include but shall not be limited to: (i) energy and fuel costs, (ii) transmission costs and losses, (iii) congestion costs, (iv) scheduling fees, (v) penalties, inadvertent energy flow charges, or imbalance charges that are exclusive of MDEA's Ancillary Service charges (vi) taxes (other than income taxes); (vii) fees, penalties, or charges imposed by the SPP, SERC, ISO or RTO, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), or other similar authorities; (viii) broker fees; (ix) communication costs (x) other associated costs incurred by EPMI.?

For example, who is responsible for paying for Point to Point service (which would probably be needed in order to import/export power from Entergy or when sourcing/selling to a non-designated resource.) Also, there is a huge risk that PTP (or the ability to add a network resource) will not be available at the time when importing/exporting power is most economical. EPMI can reserve/schedule on behalf of Clarksdale, but will Clarksdale be paying for the extra transmission service? (b) Entergy's policies allow for a day ahead designation of network resources, if transmission is available. However, this designation is not as firm as the network service that Clarksdale will be purchasing when requesting its original network. It seems that we can state that we will not impact Clarksdale's original network resource designation; however, when using an alternate designation, there is the possibility that the transmission could be cut before the rest of firm. We can agree to this, but lose flexibility. I agree that we would then need the local quick start generation in order to meet this request (however, such plant may not be available either.) No. 6 Both of the above tie into this one (as well as the ""profit"" calculation in No. 3) -- how is the ""goal"" of minimizing the resulting net power supply costs measured? EPMI will probably not be totally successful in having a cost reduction 100% of the time, especially if we try to use non-firm transmission at times because generally that imported/exported power cost can be to their advantage. Since the Cities will have final approval, they may want to take some risk and use non-firm: understanding that sometimes it won't work and the plant may have to run. This wording also needs to be clarified as to ""arrange"" -- for example, ""reserve transmission on behalf of Clarksdale""; ""schedule transactions via etag on behalf of Clarksdale.""

I would like to clarify the differences between the TECO deal and the MDEA deal. The TECO-Frontera deal consists of EPMI marketing the excess capacity off the Frontera plant. TECO has some existing sales off that plant which are not incorporated in our profit sharing arrangement (""Existing Transactions""). Also, we agreed to work with them to sell ""Structured Transactions"" off the plant. The ""Back-to-Back Transactions"" refer to the daily sale of MW off the plant, that EPMI is sleeving for TECO. I understand that we may have opportunities to sell excess generation off MDEA's generation assets, however, I don't think the bulk of the contract should focus on this. There is little mention of the obligation to serve the Native Load through 3rd party transactions, which as I understand it, is the intent of the MDEA deal. 2) Definitions section: Existing Transactions - defined as MDEA having prior obligations to sell energy etc. - I don't think MDEA has any of these outside of their Native Load. Marketing Strategy - This mentions a Trading and Risk policy. The policy used for TECO mentions that EPMI will provide VAR reports. This will not be done for Clarksdale/Yazoo. 3) Section 4 - Availability of Products; Metering Risk of loss and all price, credit, and unit contingency.... I thought we were bearing credit risk with 3rd parties. Further down in the paragraph in parens... (and execute a Confirmation evidencing such obligation)... We need to check with the Deal Clearing group what they will be confirming. Normally, hourly trades do not get confirmed. I have not yet informed anyone in confirms about this deal because I was assuming we would not have to provide confirms to MDEA. Please let me know if this is not the case. 4) Section 8 - Performance Standards (b) (1) Availability calculation is using 480 MW, this is the Frontera plant capacity. 5) Section 9 - Delivery Point and Title What about sales to MDEA from EPMI (this goes back to my statement in #1 that this contract focuses more on the buy side instead of the sale). 6) Section 11 - Fuel management services I thought we were sleeving the gas, therefore, EPMI will be a party to the Fuel Related Transactions. 6) Section 16 - Payment and Fees Existing Transaction Costs are mentioned - These may be irrelevant to this section ""Market Proceeds"" - I think this should more specifically state that this is only in relation to the Mwhrs sold off their facilities to a 3rd party. MOST IMPORTANTLY - There is no mention of how EPMI will be reimbursed for the power that we purchase on MDEA's behalf. I expect that this will be most of the settlement activity related to this deal. 7) Exhibit [] REPORTS 1) Profit & Loss, Risk Statement - This says that we will track the change in value of the power output. We are not going to monitor the forward value of their positions. 2) Position Statement - This will not be done at all. To truly give an accurate position statement, we would need to forecast their load for the next two years, and then economically dispatch the plants to see what their net short position is. I don't think this is relevant, and per my previous conversations with Reagan, we are not doing this. In the TECO agreement, we are giving a forward view of the value of the plant. This cannot be done for MDEA because we cannot determine when we are dispatching to serve their load or to sell to a 3rd party. This is all for now.... E "

(IE, you have four power definitions) FOR GAS The receipt point for gas is defined in each individual deal Confirm where gas may be purchased, and then transported to MDEA. There are 3 delivery points for gas: for Clarksdale it is the interconnect between Texas Gas and Clarksdale for Yazoo City you have (a) the interconnect between Southern Natural Gas (Sonat) and Mississippi Valley Gas for the Yazoo City Power Plant (Sonat Delivery Point) (b) the interconnect between Mississippi Valley Gas (MVG) and the Yazoo City Power Plant (MVG Delivery Point) Off Peak Definition This is the same definition as the ON PEAK definition, except the off peak hours beginning and ending are the opposite of the on peak hours.

Jim Homco questioned whether we should buy the fuel oil. What do you want to do? [Rorschach, Reagan] Leave the fuel out of the deal. I've added the definition of Scheduling Equipment Costs. How should it be used in the agreement? Are we limiting our provision of scheduling equipment to the equipment listed in the exhibit? [Rorschach, Reagan] The guaranteed monthly fee we discuss in 13(b)(1) covers the equipment costs. This is an estimate. If we spend more than that, we need to be able to go backto Marvin for more money. Rick Broussard is reviewing the equipment schedule for completeness. What financial security will be required of them? [Rorschach, Reagan] I will ask Ed Sacks Are we attaching Marketing Strategy and Trading/Risk policy, or establishing a time line?

Also, a customer does not have transmission until it is confirmed on OASIS. Either PTP (firm or non-firm) or the additional off system resources (have to list a source) under network would need to be purchased for wheeling in and out of Entergy to make parking/lending effective. p.9 ""Delivery Point"" --This point is actually the ""POR"" /Point of Receipt for tariff purposes if generating the power or the POD/Point of Delivery if wheeling into Clarksdale. p. 10 says that EPMI would manage the existing firm transmission rights. As of now, I don't think Clarksdale has the transmission rights (since Marvin is submitting the request today). Therefore, for contract purposes, want to have language that gives them the risk of not getting transmission approved by Entergy. Firm can be difficult to obtain. Can also include a provision that non-firm could be used, if available, but EPMI probably does not want to take any transmission risk. Non-firm is close to non-existent in the summer. p. 12 Be careful about using the term ""balanced schedules"" for supply, load and transmission capacity from all entities it serves. We are fighting any RTO requirements for day ahead balanced schedules. NERC in May is considering changes certain rules that would allow marketers, etc. the advantages of parking and lending through the submission of schedules (although it probably won't pass.) In any event, I think that ""appropriate schedules, as required by the SPP (or successor organization) rules, practices, etc...."" is safer language. Thanks.

Answers to the this relationship structure will be necessary prior to proposing credit terms for both the Master Gas and Master Power agmts.

I don't think this is defined anywhere, and in the TECO transaction this refers to existing gas supply contracts. Reagan - Does MDEA have any existing gas supply contracts? As a general comment, do we need to define the cost of serving their load through third party purchases? 2) Section 2 - Term Whose option is it to extend the term of this deal? It sounds like both parties have the right to extend, but then later in the paragraph it states MDEA has the right to extend. In the TECO agreement, TECO had a unilateral right to extend the contract for the first year. 3) Section 8 - Accounting and Reports paragraph (c) refers to Existing Transactions - I thought we were taking this out. 4) Section 10 - Delivery Point and Title Do we need to state where EPMI delivers to MDEA? 5) Section 11 - Fuel Management Services It is my understanding that at the beginning of this agreement, ENA will 'sleeve' the gas purchases, and the ultimate goal is to help MDEA set up master agreements with multiple parties. However, my interpretation of the statement in para (a) ""The parties recognize that without MDEA's full and active participation....EPMI will not be able to procure fuel for the facilities or seek to reduce Fuel Costs,"" is that we will not be sleeving any gas purchases. Is this the case? 6) Section 13 - Payment and Fees It is my expectation that most months, we will be billing MDEA to pay our costs of serving their load, not redeeming to MDEA the Market Proceeds. I think that para (a) is a little confusing because it mixes the two of these together. I think it may be easier to understand if these two are broken out. Also, there will be times that we may have to sell off energy that we have overpurchased to serve their load. We need to explicitly define how this will be handled. Reagan - Here are a few comments about the exhibits: 1) Exhibit [] - Reports I think I said this in my last e-mail, but the P&L, Risk Statement will not include 'various risk indicators for MDEA's power output for the term of this agreement' We may need to talk about this further. 2) Exhibit XX - MDEA EPMI Incentive Fee Calculation Let's talk about this.

Yazoo City and Clarksdale say they are pulling = =20 out of the eight-city energy-supply association because they can provide = =20 power to their cities less expensively on their own. =09 =09MEAM says that they have the right to do this, but only in accordance w= ith=20 the original MEAM contract, which specifies that an entity can only withdr= aw=20 from the agency on condition of five years=01, written notice. This provis= ion=20 is typical of this type contract and lends a degree of stability to a=20 coalition of political bodies. =09 =09Complicating the matter is the fact the MEAM has financed the upgrading = of=20 the generating facilities at Yazoo City and Clarksdale. The total project= =20 upgraded three frame-five gas turbines and added three waste heat recovery= =20 steam generators and cost in excess of $10 million. Part of this project w= as=20 paid for by MEAM revenues and the rest by a $5 million 1994 bond issue. =09 =09The Greenwood generating facility was also part of this project, but =20 Greenwood elected to pay out of other resources rather than participate in = =20 the bond issue. This leaves seven cities responsible for the bond issue an= d=20 dependent on the generating capacity of the two cities for a portion of=20 their electrical power supply. =09 =09MEAM also purchases power from other resources to supplement the genera= ting=20 capacity of Yazoo City, Clarksdale and Greenwood. SEPA, Cajun Electric=20 Cooperative, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and Entergy Services, Inc. are amon= g=20 recent suppliers with Entergy holding the largest contracts. =09 =09The exit of Yazoo City and Clarksdale from MEAM would hurt the organiza= tion=20 not only in loss of generating power but also in the loss of volume=20 purchasing power from other supplies. This type loss is one of the reasons= =20 for a five-year notice in the original contract. The other cities involved= =20 in MEAM would be given time to deal with the adverse impact. =09 =09Clarksdale and Yazoo City, however, say that MEAM has broken its contra= ct=20 with them. The two cities plan to form their own alliance to take advantag= e=20 of the savings that they perceive to be available in the deregulated=20 wholesale energy market. They also plan to buy out the bond issue obligati= on=20 from MEAM and finance it through revenue bond issues of their own. =09 =09At this point the story breaks down into two other issues. One is a ver= y=20 legitimate difference in style of operation and management between MEAM an= d=20 the two cities. The other is a rather obvious problem with power, =20 personality and disgruntlement. =09 =09Neil Davis, General Manager for MEAM, admits to being conservative in h= is=20 management style. ""I=01,m the first to say we=01,re not where we=01,d like = to be=20 costwise,"" Davis says, ""but we know that we=01,ve controlled and lowered c= osts=20 over the years. We=01,re very competitive and have the lowest costs in the= area. =09 =09""Entergy views MEAM as a good wholesale customer and they do all they c= an to=20 work with us.

We know Entergy can and will do this and we don=01,t = have=20 the track record with other suppliers."" =09 =09Bob Priest, General Manager of the Yazoo City Public Service Commission= , is=20 much more daring in his approach. ""You have to take a risk from time to=20 time,"" he says. ""MEAM hasn=01,t changed in the last ten years, and the uti= lity=20 industry has changed drastically."" =09 =09Public Service and other officials from both Clarksdale and Yazoo City = are=20 furious about the new contract with ESI. Both cities would prefer not to d= o=20 business with Entergy at all, an attitude that has little or nothing to do= =20 with MEAM. Both parties admit that there have been divisive issues for thr= ee=20 or four years, but the recent contract seems to have been the straw that= =20 broke the camel=01,s back. =09 =09Sources who prefer to remain unnamed say that there are other problems. = =20 Various people are angry at staff for various personal reason. Others see = a=20 conflict of interest in Public Service professionals being on the Board, = =20 which was designed as a citizen review entity.

We build into all of these contracts that the counterparty may at any time, chose to transact directly with a third counterparty. We would still administer the contracts and perform the scheduling etc. for them if they chose to do this. In this way, the customer may always chose to deal directly if they chose and we would be doing the scheduling. I believe that this will serve to counteract concerns that we will not provide them fair market prices since they could always chose to deal directly. We are confident that our prices are will be competitive and that the counterparty will chose to transact through us. We would of course need to protect our share of the benefit in the case they transact with someone else. Tom.

I am glad that you came to this conclusion. The way the contract is written now provides that MDEA can do term deals on their own with third parties. Our profit calcs are covered. On the other hand, MDEA does not have the ability to do hourly and daily type deals with third parties. We can talk about this aspect and I can give you the reasons for doing it this way. In referring to the way the contract is written, take that comment with a grain of salt since we have not finished the contract, and a lot of areas like this may need work by our side (commercial) so that Kay can finish the doc.

We build into all of these contracts that the counterparty may at any time, chose to transact directly with a third counterparty. We would still administer the contracts and perform the scheduling etc. for them if they chose to do this. In this way, the customer may always chose to deal directly if they chose and we would be doing the scheduling. I believe that this will serve to counteract concerns that we will not provide them fair market prices since they could always chose to deal directly. We are confident that our prices are will be competitive and that the counterparty will chose to transact through us. We would of course need to protect our share of the benefit in the case they transact with someone else. Tom.

What will be the contracted process for setting the Bogey? ? What heat rates or heat rate ranges will go in the contract? ? Can we create a schedule to collar the Bogey given a certain gas price? ? Can we get a gas management fee for being the Fuel Manager? (this is a retrade) ? How does the network service transmission agreement including ancillary services get accounted for in the ""cost"" calculation? ? How does Imballance get sorted out at the end of the the month as a profit or a cost? Regarding calculation of the Bogey, we have several issues. First, what is the methodology? Rick is very close to having a stack model that incorporates the business rules including minimum run times, startup costs, VOM, etc. Second, what are the daily inputs and who is responsible for running the model? This process will need to be documented every time the calc is performed. Third, what is the timing of the calc? We discussed getting the input info by 2am and doing the calc on a ""day ahead"" basis. Only on a select basis would the calc be re-done mid-day. We are planning on meeting with Marvin next week and working to resolution on these issues. This should result in a set of business rules that can be put into the contract. Please comment/correct/add/subtract to any or all of the above. David Fairley and I will be sending out the Marketing Strategy and Trading and Risk Policy later this morning. Thanks, Reagan "

Their next Board meeting (after tonight's Board meeting) is June 12 , and they desperately need to have our contract finished in time to get signing approval at that meeting. We probably need something to bridge us from the end of May until their Board votes on the full agreement. The other option is to get done this week and have them call a special Board meeting.

Do we have the GADS (?)? Is it a daily average, weekly average? Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often? [Fairley, David] Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model. As conditions change the utilities must update this info. We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage. Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability. No GADS. Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps.. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions? [Fairley, David] Yes, their units are too small. We have discussed this with the customer, and with our internal air permit guys. [Rorschach, Reagan] They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to us today. They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are limited on oil. Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right? [Fairley, David] We won't buy and sell fuel oil. We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product transaction with the resulting profit split. [Rorschach, Reagan] We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies. We aren't making money on gas, right? [Fairley, David] We make money on gas two ways. The first is outside the contract, and is basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities. The second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product trade, and those procedures apply. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture? [Fairley, David] Yes, will send separately. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits? [Fairley, David] The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of Asset Management have been upated. The other Exhibits have not been modified. The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their comments/questions incorporated. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae: The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on. [Fairley, David] Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties. Will look at it again. Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough. [Rorschach, Reagan] See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example. Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? [Fairley, David] There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances? Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement. EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances. Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties. A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure. How are we setting the bogey? Formula? [Fairley, David] The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day. Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the day's activities. [Rorschach, Reagan] Records of bogey decisions will be archieved Subject to audit? [Fairley, David] Yes, but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day. Frankly, they would like to have less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day. Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)? [Fairley, David] One bogey for power. Gas is an input for determining the bogey. [Rorschach, Reagan] Bogey set day-ahead. What is defn of profit? I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check. [Fairley, David] This is in the pricing calc's. Should we have a definition? What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David] see cost definition being provided separately. Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. [Fairley, David] See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. [Fairley, David] Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem. What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits? Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power? [Rorschach, Reagan] I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly. We need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports. It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around. Thanks, Kay"

Andrea's number is 212-657-1007, and she will likely ask regarding the nature/timing/amounts of the disbursements. In past deals, Citibank has provided us with a fee schedule and a list of money market investment options, so I imagine we will need to ask Andrea for copies of the same. According to Carolyn, Andrea might refer you to a woman named Estelle Lawrence at 212-657-2076, but the initial contact needs to be with Andrea.

If you like, we can set up a time to discuss these comments. As I mentioned on the phone, many of the comments directed at Part 1, Item 1 are due to the fact I do not have a signed copy of Consent to Assignment. I am searching for a copy at this end, but if you have ready access, a copy would be appreciated. Part I 1. The base contract defines the party GE is contracting with as the ""Purchaser"". LJM2is the Purchaser under the base contract. I understand assignment of the contract by LJM2 to E-Next is under consideration and was supposed to have occurred in December. I do not have a copy of the Consent signed by GE or any other signed documents indicating that the assignment has taken place. Assuming the assignment has taken place, according to the unsigned documentation I have, Enron North America Corp. should be replaced as the contracting party in paragraph 1 by E-Next Generation LLC as the party that is contracting with GE and is the Purchaser. As I understand the draft Consent agreement, Enron North America is supposed to be the Agent for E-Next and is not the Purchaser. This is consistent with the cover page of the draft CO No. 2. Revision 5 to the Change Order does not quite succeed in making the correction. It should say ""... between General Electric Company (""Seller"") and E-Next Generation LLC (""Purchaser"") dated May 31, 2000 (the ""Agreement""), Purchaser, acting through its Agent, Enron North America Corp., hereby amends ..."". However, CO No. 2 with this correction to paragraph 1 should not be signed by GE until GE has agreed to the assignment to E-Next. Otherwise, the signed CO. No. 2 could, by itself, be construed as consent by GE to the assignment. 2.1 Delete the added language that begins with the words ""on or prior to the Guaranteed Unit Shipment Date(s)..."". Because Unit No. 1 is going to storage and the customer controls when it is released from storage and when it gets to the jobsite, the risk of late delivery originally assigned by the contract to GE has shifted to the customer. This is recognized in section 5.5.2 of the contract which states that if GE is directed to ship to storage, for the purpose of assessing LDs and final payment, GE's delivery obligation is deemed fulfilled. The original guaranteed delivery dates are no longer relevant. If the Unit 1 equipment is close enough to being ready for delivery that it must be shipped to storage because the customer cannot take possession of it, it does not matter if we ship to storage before or after the contract delivery dates. 2.2 The comment to 2.1 applies to this paragraph also. Further, there is no guaranteed delivery date for non-Major Components as long as delivery of that equipment does not impede the continuous progress of installation. 2.4 Delete the words ""unless caused by Seller or its Subcontractor"" at the end of this paragraph. Otherwise, the paragraph first takes a responsibility away from GE and then re-imposes it. As I understand it, there is a significant possibility that some cosmetic deterioration to external surfaces will occur to the equipment while it is in storage. This is a function of the storage conditions and GE is responsible for those conditions. 2.6 Delete in its entirety the second sentence which reads ""Passage of title and warranty obligations of Seller with respect to the Unit 1 Equipment remain unchanged under the Agreement"". Article 5.5.2 makes it clear that Purchaser's direction to place equipment into storage causes title to pass and delivery for the purposes of LDs and final payment to occur even though Purchaser has not taken physical possession of the stored equipment. 5.5.2 also indicates that all expenses incurred by Seller as the result of placing equipment into storage shall be payable by Purchaser. These expenses include any extension of the Primary Warranty Period that results from storage. The deleted sentence should be replaced by: ""The parties agree that the Primary Warranty Period for Unit 1 Equipment placed into storage shall be determined in accordance with Article 14.1.1 of the Agreement except that the Primary Warranty Period shall end for the gas turbine and generator no later than March 11, 2004 and for the balance of the Unit 1 Equipment on March 31, 2004 unless extended by mutual agreement."" 2.10 We will insure the equipment to 100% of its purchase price.

RE: Section 2.6 and Jeff's comment to end Warranty on March 11, 2004. Under the Contract, the Primary Warranty period has a sunset date of 36 months after completion of delivery of each Unit. If I knew for certain that March 11, 2001 that the Unit would be in storage, I would have no problem acknowledging that the sunset date would be March 11, 2004. If we establish the storage facility as the Delivery Point, then the Contract language takes us to the same point, and I do not have to hold my breath while the train moves the CT to the storage facility. In addition, I want to keep the Primary Warranty Period the same for all the parts of the Unit 1, so the final delivery to storage should start the clock running for the purposes of the Installation Period, deemed Acceptance, and the 36 months sunset date in Contract Section 14.1.1, as I have now drafted C.O. 2, Section 2.6. 2. RE: Section 2.11 and Kay's comment that except for the cosmetic deterioration we address in C.O. 2, Section 2.4, it seems the language could be interpreted that I am letting GE off the hook for all liability when risk of damage and loss passes per this section.

Furthermore, the latest guidelines are much more precise, technically correct and reflect all of the agreements that GE and us have reached over the last year or so. I understand that we do not want to go into a whole new set of reviews, etc, but I believe I can modify the ARCOS guidelines to address the testing of gas turbines (gas and oil) relatively quickly, get together with GE's performance engineer, go over the guidelines and have everybody agreeing rather rapidly.

Pursuant to the new language in Section 3.1.5 (Right to Purchase Turbine), please confirm that, upon execution of the LLC Agreement, the LLC shall have acquired ""all of ENA's rights and interest in, to and under the Turbine Contract."" 2. We recommend that your tax specialists sign off on the new language in Sections 4.7 and 8.3(b) and in Article 6. 3. The revised put and call provisions (Sections 7.2(a) and (c)) allow Northwestern to exercise its call rights with relative freedom but force ENA to wait until Takeover or 12/31/02 before exercising the put. This, of course, changes the deal. 4. Paul Hasting's additions to Section 11.14 (a) limits the pool of arbitrators to those arbitrators on file with the AAA in Montana and (b) selects the State of Montana as the place of arbitration. We recommend that ENA reject these two changes and leave in the original provisions. Call us at your convenience to discuss. Regards, Marisa <<Reuter, Maria I.

The issues are as follows: 1. In Section 6(h) regarding the Change Order, Marguerite has added a rider pursuant to which ENA would be required ""to cause the Original Purchaser and/or the Agent to use commercially reasonable efforts to afford NorSub (or its agent or representative), upon request of NorSub, such opportunity or opportunities to discuss with GE (or to consult with GE concerning) such matters pertaining to the Turbines and/or the Original Turbine Contract as NorSub desires to discuss with GE (or to consult with GE concerning) and which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to discuss with (or concerning which GE is obligated under the Original Turbine Contract to consult with) the Purchaser and/or Agent thereunder; provided, however, that each of ENA, the Original Purchaser and the Agent shall have the right to be present at, and to participate in, each such discussion (or consultation."" According to Jerry DeBerry, Michael Young raised this concept with Ben, and Ben accepted it in principle. Please confirm if you are okay with this rider going into the Letter Agreement. 2. In Section 8(a), Marguerite has added a clause whereby ENA agrees to be responsible for, and to pay GE when due, and to hold the LLC and NorSub harmless from any damages or indemnification payments which become due and payable to GE on and after the Closing Date as a result of any event occurring, or any circumstance arising, prior to the Closing Date. Since this provision effectively shifts the Change Order risk onto ENA, Kay suggests that we only accept the provision if a reciprocal provision is included that allows ENA to terminate the agreement as a result of any event or circumstance that increases the Purchase Amount. Do you agree? 3. Finally, with respect to the LLC Agreement, NorthWestern would like to be able to exercise its call rights with relative freedom while forcing ENA to wait until Takeover or 12/31/02 before being able to exercise its put rights. Neither Jerry nor Marguerite understands why ENA cares when NorthWestern takes ENA out. Jerry and Marguerite were working on scheduling a conference call for sometime tomorrow, so I will send you an e-mail confirming the details as soon as I hear back from them.

Subject: Comments to Turbine Purchase Documents We have forwarded to you via facsimile our comments to the Letter Agreement and the LLC Agreement. The majority of our comments, as you will note, are intended to clarify the understanding of the parties with respect to the various matters set forth in such documents and are not intended to ""change the deal"". Except that, upon the advise of our tax counsel, we have adjusted the amounts of the promissory notes to be issued in connection with the transaction in order to maximize the LLC's basis in the Turbines. We believe this is consistent with your initial draft of the Letter Agreement. Also, please note that we have included additional language in Section 6 of the Letter Agreement which provides NorthWestern with the opportunity to consult with GE on matters relating to the Turbines. This reflects our understanding of an agreement that had been reached among the parties. With respect to the LLC Agreement, we would like to discuss with you the following: (i) the timing of the exercise of the Call Right and (ii) the intent of your proposed language in Section 7 relating to the rights of each Member to act in its own best interests with respect to the Call and Put Rights. To that end, we propose scheduling a conference call on Tuesday afternoon, April 11, 2001. Please contact me as soon as possible with a time that is convenient for your team. We look forward to hearing from you. Note: We will forward to you shortly, revised drafts of the documents for which we have drafting responsibility. ************************************************ Jeremiah A. DeBerry, Esq.

I don't know that we really have significant points of disagreement. They understand that we are working some accounting issues, and they have a general idea of what we want to do. I suggested that we come up with the work arounds with our accountants, and I will think about it this weekend. I have a couple of ideas but I really want to mull it over. They look forward to receiving the turbine contract. Chris, could you forward the draft change orders with it? One point they raised is that they want the ability (with GE consent) to have us refund the future payment due to GE (less 7% for time value of money), retaining the payment obligation. All of this is post closing. They are putting up a full blown parent guaranty to GE for the turbine contract, and since the payment should only be around $4mm, that would probably be acceptable to GE. Keffer et al will issue revised documents tonight. There are no calls scheduled tomorrow or this weekend, giving everyone ""quiet time"" to review the contract. Other than the accting issues, this should be about it. We deferred discussions about an extension until Monday. Kay "

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to the assignment and sale of the member interests. The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC (we have had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson. Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized in Q2 vs. Q3. Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or if you have any other questions. Regards, Ben"

I have not analyzed the TurboPark deal to determine what would constitute an event of default in that deal and at the same time preclude our ability to exercise our call option. Finance / Accounting have not provided specific guidance on this. 2. We have spoke to GE. We have advised them of the deal with Northwestern. We do not believe the acknowledgement and consent will be a problem, and that it will follow the same discussion process as has been going on regarding Pastoria. 3. NW does not have negotiating rights on the acknowledgement and consent. They must accept it to the extent the one we receive for this deal is substantially the same as the one for Pastoria (we've attached the Pastoria form to the letter agreement). 4. If NW flakes, we keep the $8 million, can sue them to close, and can resell the units. This remote scenario would likely provide us with additional upside. 5. The only scenario that we don't get paid are the two scenarios outlined in my previous e-mail: we cannot obtain the GE acknowledgement and consent, or we otherwise cannot effect the assignment because of a default in E Next. NW does not have any other outs. 6. The income from the deal is expected to be at least $8 million, but could be as high as $10 million depending on the exact closing date, and potential LDs we may receive from GE. I've attached the DASH which contains an income analysis.

Also enclosed are redlined drafts of each marked to reflect revisions from the initial drafts furnished earlier today. We believe that our revised description of the ""transaction"" in the Letter Agreement (which now provides that each event is a condition precedent to the other and is deemed to have occurred simultaneous with the other) should satisfy your concerns as to both the creditworthiness issue and the timing issue. At the closing, the signed Facility Agreement will not be ""delivered"" unless the loan is funded by Tejas. With respect to your concern about confidentiality, we have reviewed the confidentiality provisions of the master contract. One might conclude that the master contract does not expressly permit the disclosure of confidential information by Enron to prospective assignees, as a ""Permitted Assignee"" seems to include only an assignee who has received an assignment. On the other hand, it is arguable that there would never be any assignee without some disclosure, so that disclosure to prospective assignees must have been intended by the parties. Alternatively, query whether Enron's ""performance of its obligations"" under the master agreement could be construed to include using [and disclosing] confidential information in discussions with prospective assignees and their lenders, thereby permitting disclosure to Coral/Tejas under the second full paragraph of Section 21.1. Assuming that we can satisfy ourselves with respect to this issue, it then seems prudent to require Coral/Tejas to immediately execute a Confidentiality Agreement containing confidentiality restrictions comparable to those set forth in the master agreement. In the alternative, you may wish to revise the letter of intent (assuming it is to be executed momentarily) to include comparable confidentiality provisions. Please review the enclosed and advise of any additional comments. If we may be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to call. Thank you. Carolyn M.

As you mentioned, we need the site specific information to complete the agreements; however, there are a few additional points that I wanted to bring to your attention: 1. Please confirm that Unit 17 is going to CA Energy Development I, and Unit 18 is going to CA Energy Development II. 2. The document needs a fax number for Ben Jacoby and the Agreement Reference number. 3. I need to get the cost of the dual fuel option so I can calculate the maximum liability amount. (Peter mentions that there's a change order 1. Do you have that available?) Also, I assume that we'll simply add the dual fuel cost to the contract value to calculate the maximum liability amount and add 25% of the dual fuel cost to the January payment to arrive at the new payment amount. Is this correct, or is there another way it should be done? 4. Also, I need the unit serial numbers if you'd like them included in the agreement. 5. Will the Retention Letter of Credit be structured differently now that only one turbine is being sold per agreement? (I'm assuming that the figure will be 5% of the purchase price after the dual fuel cost is included). That's all I have for now. Peter has been in a conference call all afternoon, so if you've already given some or all of this information to him, please let me know. You can reach me via e-mail or at (202) 662-3016.

Do we have to amend the attached Agreement to reflect the assignment of the Purchase Option to the LLCs instead of Enron and, is this possible under the master agreement? Or, does this assign the Purchase Option to Enron who will then assign it to the LLCs? Please advise. Also, as Kay Mann, Rose Engeldorf, and I agreed on Friday evening, we did not send out the purchase option notice. However, we still need to provide formal notice in order to provide sufficient time for WLB to make the appropriate arrangements. The concern was whether Enron would trigger any balance sheet issues by providing notice to West LB. I will be in the office by 7:30 AM on Monday and would like to meet to discuss any outstanding issues as soon as possible. Raimund D. Grube "

The Facility Agreement is the ""break-out contract"" for the single transformer (LNL 9517-1) being assigned to CA Energy Development II, L.L.C., in which Enron is presently selling 80% of the member interests to Coral (the parent of Tejas Energy NS Holdings, L.L.C.). The remaining 20% will be sold to them after commercial operations of their plant. Please have this acknowledgement letter reviewed as soon as possible. I assume there should not be any issue as the total transformer contract will be paid in full (except for the retainage) prior to the execution of the Facility Agreement.

As mentioned on the telephone, I have retained a number of the representations and warranties requested by Coral, with modifications where necessary to eliminate those aspects which were objectionable to Enron. The justification for this is that nearly any purchaser would insist on such representations, and it is often more advantageous to present a draft that appears to be neutral, rather than allow the counterparty to focus on what is not there and then have the advantage of drafting precisely what it wants. Therefore, we suggest that Enron carefully review the representations and warranties in order that any objectionable items can be eliminated before circulation of documents to the counterparty. Because we rearranged and reorganized the representations and warranties to make a more clear presentation, the blacklined drafts will not be very helpful fur purposes of reviewing representations and warranties.

I wanted to pass on a few things that were discussed immediately prior to the execution of the LOI just so that nothing is lost in the changing of the guards. 1) John Keffer asked ENA to determine whether the equity interest held by ENA in the SPV must be a voting interest. The concern here was that the LLC Agreement was structured to have the 20% owner hold a non-voting member interest and John wanted to be certain that this satisfied the terms of the GE LM6000 contract; 2) The LOI talks about the ""minimal representations"" that ENA will be required to give to Coral in connection with the disposition of the 80% member interest to the Acquisition Entity. I spoke with Jim Shepherd (internal counsel to Coral - who by the way was a colleague/friend of mine when I was employed at Coral) and assured him that ENA would be willing to provide the necessary reps to give Coral comfort that we hadn't done anything with the SPV (i.e. incur liabilities or convey other interests in the SPV); 3) Jim Shepherd and I also spoke about expressly incorporating the confidentiality provisions of the LOI into the final deal documentation. I wanted to be certain that Coral could not discuss deal terms with anyone else (for fear that the deal structure becomes known in the market place); 4) On the matter of taxes, Don Whaley (of Coral) expressly agreed with Ben Jacoby that all ad valorem taxes and other taxes associated with ownership (and the sale/transfer) of the units would be borne by Coral. This comment about the ad valorem taxes (which aren't expressly stated in the LOI) is particularly important because (as you know) we anticipate a $250,000 tax on each turbine that is delivered prior to year end. I believe that Ben wants to execute a letter agreement with GE (similar to the one that was executed for the first 14 units) pursuant to which we accept title/delivery in consideration of a $300,000 waiver of cancellation fees. I have reservations about this because ENA will effectively be making an additional 300k per unit by stuffing a $250,000 obligation to Coral. Doesn't really pass the smell test in my book. 5) One final item, this deal has not been DASHed and a legal risk memo has not been prepared. I would think that the biggest legal risk in this transaction is the risk of discovery of the true deal structure by GE. I prepared a legal risk memo that highlighted this risk when I did the original deal with Air Liquide and am happy to share that with you if you so desire. Again, many thanks. Stuart"

Based on current information, the structure of the transaction has not materially changed from the Coral deal structure described in the 11/30/00 DASH. Intergen is holding a Board meeting this afternoon and the proposed transaction is on the agenda for approval. With regard to the timing of the funding, it is my understanding that once the Letter Agreement has been executed (target date: 12/21) and associated documents accepted by Intergen, Enron will notify TurboPark of its intention to assign the equipment to Intergen (target notice date: 12/22). Once the assignment documents are ready for execution, Intergen will fund the transaction and Enron will execute the assignment documents immediately after receiving written confirmation that Enron has received the transaction proceeds. There is a desire by East Origination to, if possible, book the earnings from this transaction in fiscal year 2000. Rebecca Walker (ENA development) is planning to run a D&B report on Sweetgum Energy L.P. tomorrow once she receives the State and Headquarters information necessary. I traded voicemails with Ben Glisan today on this counterparty change. He asked that I work with RAC deal personell on this matter. Based upon your voicemail it appears that we do not need to amend the DASH based upon this change in counterparty. Let me know if any of the above information changes your opinion.

I need to determine if RAC believes that the 11/30/00 [Coral Energy] DASH is sufficient for the transaction signing to proceed tomorrow or if a revised DASH needs to be prepared and circulated for re-approval. Relative to the approved 11/30 DASH, the major changes in the deal structure are as follows: 1. At the request of Coral Energy, the counterparty to the proposed transaction has changed from Coral Energy to Intergen (or its designated affiliate, Sweetgum Energy L.P.). 2. Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the removal of the requirement for an Intergen Parent Guarantee. The major risk (i.e. non-payment risk) associated with the removal of this Guarantee has been mitigated by requiring Intergen to fund an escrow account with the transaction sales proceeds prior to Enron's execution of the equipment Assigment Agreement. 3. Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to the insertion of a ""no-shop"" clause which serves to prevent Enron from offering/soliciting the turbines & transformers to other parties once Intergen has signed the Letter Agreement(s). 4. Enron has requested, and Intergen has not yet agreed, to the modification of the transaction ""sunset dates"". These are the dates by which, once the Letter Agreement is signed, that Enron must deliver the required Facilities Agreements, GE acknowledgement letter, and fully executed Assignment Agreement. This modification proposes that the dates be moved from 12/29/00 to 1/15/01. The Enron commercial deal team is awaiting confirmation from Enron Global Finance that the executed Assignment Agreement can be delivered within these timeframes. 5. Intergen has requested, and Enron has agreed, to a modification of the Transferability section of the Agreement in order to address an equipment warranty risk that the current language represents to Intergen. The modification would serve to limit Enron's ability to exercise its ""put option"" on its 20% member interest in the turbine/transformer L.L.C.(s) by requiring either: 1) the expiration of the GE warranty, or 2) the written consent of GE to Enron's ownership transfer in a form acceptable to Intergen. This modification is acceptable to Enron as it represents an earlier potential put option exercise date under scenario 1) above than the current Agreement language. Please review this information and let me know (via email) if RAC requires the DASH to be revised and re-approved. Call me to discuss. Fred x35406 "

Will there be a second set of documents for the LLC getting the transformer as well as the turbine? 2. Tax liability - I think we should broaden the tax section to offload responsibility for taxes related to the transfer and ownership of the equipment, not just the sale. I believe this should be a TEH responsibility. 3. Terminology - Breakout contract should be Facility Agreement, and commercial operations should be as defined in the Facility Agreement (a reference is fine). 4. Confidentiality - any reason not to have them agree to be bound by the confidentiality provisions in the facility agreement? If fact, please review the confidentiality provisions in the GE agreement so that we can discuss same. 5. Creditworthiness - looks like we may have an issue here. We should specifiy that the note should be from a credit worthy entity, or guaranteed by a credit worthy entity. 6. Timing of delivery of contract and funding - in discussing this matter with our commercial lead, Ben Jacoby, he indicated that he believed that the obligation to fund would be contemporaneous with the delivery of the facility agreement, or stated another way, a condition precedent to the obligation to fund as opposed to existing (as a signed document) as of the time of signing. 7. Reps - as we discussed, Enron should rep that it has the ability to convey the equipment, or other such language, as opposed to getting into the nitty gritty of our financing structure. I'm still reviewing and collecting comments, but this gives you an idea of where we are headed. Thanks, Kay"

This schedule represents one of four documents required to effect a smooth transfer of the relevant equipment interests from TurboPark into the respective CA Development entity and close this transaction prior to the 1/15/01 deadline. Call me to discuss any of this information. Fred "

We need two separate notices - one for CA I and one for CA II. Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please prepare a draft of the two exhibits? Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the participation agreement and the development and construction management agreement. I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday. By my calculations, Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th. Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a ""release letter"" for the banks and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet. Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue. I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.

Thanks for turning the docs in such a timely manner. COA is on stand by, due to our need to focus on ESA and two new, identical contracts (remember, we have a lot of turbines!) The next two up are the ones previously destined for CAL ISO - I believe units 17 & 18. These units also have the dual fuel options included, so the base prices of each will be increased appropriately. We will pay 75% of the price prior to signing the facility agreement, and the January payment will be increased by 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option. The turbines will be assigned to two sister Delaware LLCS: CA Energy Development I, LLC and CA Energy Development II, LLC. Use Ben Jacoby at 1400 Smith, Houston, 77002 for notices and invoices for purposes of the draft. We don't have any of the specifics on the site conditions, so we will have to work with generics. We would like to have a draft yesterday, but seeing as that is impossible, please advise when you think it can be ready. Thanks again and again, Kay "

Regarding the transformer, the contract counterparty is ""ABB Power T & D Company"" 2. The purchase price of the transformer ($786,000) was taken from the WLB financing book and does not include any of the capitalized interest charges or option payment (total $56,803) allocation that Global Finance has included in the calculation of the Payoff #. The full cost of the transformer would be $842,803. 3. The purchase price of each turbine ($14,072,000) was calculated as an average cost based upon a spreadsheet provided by GE. This price does not include the $280,000 in change order costs allocated to each machine. The full cost of each turbine should be $14,352,000. The $280K in change order was picked up in the original payoff # prepared by Global Finance. Ben has not yet reviewed any of the values in 2 or 3 above or the current payoff # determined by Global Finance. I will talk with him first thing in the morning. We will call you to confirm the correctness of these values. Fred"

Sheila, I hate to do this to you at this late date, but I finally figured out that the execution copy that we received via this e-mail of 2-12-01 was not the final executed version (WAS:83641.7). The final executed version (file WAS:83641.8) is attached. The changes were made by Alan Larsen on January 19, 2001 to paragraphs 6.1.2 Payment Schedule (from $ 10,892,000.00 to $ 11,572,250.00)and 6.1.3 Retention Letter(s) of Credit (amount changed to $ 720,535). This was due to the agreed upon scope and storage changes we determined were necessary at time of execution to avoid a change order. Please distribute accordingly on your side. Also, I never received my original signature pages, plus other consent documents. Also, I'm trying to get our copy of the executed CA Development I and CA Development II contract documents.

However, the breakout contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does GE know this is coming? What are you projecting for a closing date? We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract. Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much? If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house. We have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel. In fact, I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the other deal. Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I can get started on the process if you are ready.

Please note that many of our comments reflect?a change to the structure whereby the Escrow Agent would ultimately pay out the ENA fee and the progress payments to GE under the Turbine Contract on behalf of the LLC.??We prefer this structure and believe it?does not alter the underlying economics of the deal.? It is also our understanding that Enron has agreed to a financing condition precedent to DAL's obligation to make the initial deposit into the Escrow Account and our mark-up reflects this understanding. ? Regarding the LLC Agreement, our principal comment is to add an allowance for a pledge of the DAL Membership Interest without consent in connection with third party financing in Section 6.1(c) thereof.? Of course other changes to conform the Letter Agreement may be needed as well. ? We will provide additional comments to the draft Guaranty tomorrow; however, we will expect that the obligations be capped at specific dollar amount and that the term of the Guaranty would end upon the earliest occurrence of any of the events set forth in Section 5.3(c) of the Letter Agreement.? We will also need to discuss changes to the Escrow Agreement in light of our comments to the Letter Agreement. ? In the interests of time, we are distributing these comments?before our?clients have had time to review them. As such, they remain subject to their further comments and review.?

I believe that this is the total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project. Ben is planning to talk with Lee at GE. I talked with Panda this morning. They do not have a fixed close date. They are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of signing the Letter Agreement. I believe that this is doable. Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates. He is working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not yet assigned serial #'s to the units). What price are we assigning to the LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement? Let's stay consistent with that document. The person who will be signing for Panda is Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President. The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement. The balance of the purchase price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing. Is this the pricing information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont? Ben: We need to talk re: the transformers. We quoted Panda $950K per unit for the two transformers. It is not clear if the transformers will work for Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration. If we are re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at LV Co-Gen? Kathleen: I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's. I will let you know when I hear back from him.

However, the breakout contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does GE know this is coming? What are you projecting for a closing date? We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract. Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much? If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house. We have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel. In fact, I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the other deal. Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I can get started on the process if you are ready. If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's. We may want two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm.

He and Paul Hastings' HSR expert have traded voice mails exchanging information, but have not yet spoken. Bill says that Delta is apparently relying on the ""ordinary course"" exemption, which may be fine if all the LLC wants to do is hold turbines for re-sale. If the LLC works on development of a power plant, the analysis would be different. In any event, Bill agrees that the only safe thing to do is provide now for the possible requirement to file later. Prior to speaking with Bill, I also spoke with Greg Lang. He agrees that we should provide now for the possible requirement to file later. He again asserted that since this is ""Enron's structure,"" Enron should agree to bear 50% of any filing fee. Steve Thome indicated earlier today that Enron may be willing to bear half of the filing fee. Under current regulations, the filing fee will be $45k if, at the time the put/call is exercised, the assets have a fair market value of $50-100 million, and the filing fee will be $125k if, at the time the put/call is exercised, the assets of the LLC have a fair market value of $100-500 million. Please let me know whether to advise Greg that Enron will accept responsibility for half the filing fee. Thank you. Carolyn M.

(2) The parties agreed to commercially reasonable efforts to execute an escrow agreement on or before April 16, 2001. (3) The escrow account must be funded 3 business days after the later of (a) ENA's delivery of the final form of the turbine contract and (b) the closing of PPL's financing. (4) ENA can terminate if the escrow is not funded on or before April 19, 2001 (but this date gets pushed back by one business day for each business day beyond April 11, 2001 that ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract). (5) The closing occurs at least 5, but not later than 10, business days after funding the escrow account. (6) Either party may terminate if the closing has not occurred on or before May 3, 2001. If ENA delivers the final form of the turbine contract on April 11, 2001, then the April 19, 2001 right to terminate stands. PPL's obligation to fund the escrow would then be determined by the date of its loan closing. Greg Lang advises that they are working on PPL's financing, but he did not give an estimated date for financial closing. I advised Greg on Friday that the legal opinions from both GE and Enron were causing heartburn. He agreed to pass this along to Isabel Parker. He asked today about GE's reaction to the consent document and if it would be appropriate for Isabel Parker to contact GE directly at this point. He also requested a draft of the escrow disbursement instructions. When you get a chance, please advise of any comments in order that we can circulate for PPL's review. Also, we need to contact Citibank to clear the proposed form of escrow agreement (and the anticipated disbursement instructions) and to negotiate the fee. Let me know if we can assist in this regard.

Lee is totally on board, and thought this would be a great transaction. Based on this, I think our GE risk is minimal, which means that our primary commercial focus needs to be on making sure Panda is prepared to transact, and if they remain as interested, making sure we proceed with as simple a transaction as possible. I would suggest that we have an all hands conference call to discuss the transaction as soon as possible. Fred-could you please contact everyone and set this up?

If this bears out, the escrow would be funded three business days later, on Tuesday, April 24. However, ENA can terminate the letter agreement if the escrow is not funded on or before Friday, April 20. Therefore, PPL may (although I have not confirmed their intent in this regard) fund the escrow immediately following their financial closing, rather than waiting the three business days. They are proceeding under the assumption that an acceleration of payments to GE will be negotiated. If not, Plan B (the ""non-disturbance"" lien) requires additional documentation with their lenders and with ENA that may result in some delay.

I have copied Herman Manis on this since he wasn't part of your distribution and I want him to read what the sales plan is to insure that he is comfortable with it and that it agrees with what the originators and legal folks have been telling him. Re your email intro: 1. The amount owed to E-Next does not need to be included in this Notice. It must be included in the second notice we must provide to E-Next for the purchase. We refer to it as the Prepayment Notice. 2. I don't understand the flow of the sales process for this deal. My last understanding was that it was to be handled like the CA Development sale. In that deal, my understanding is that ENA assigned its purchase option to CA Dev. The sale of the LLC originally owned by ENA was sold to CA Dev prior to the $$ flowing to E-Next for the purchase of the equipment. CA Dev put the $$ in escrow first then we issued the purchase notice. Please advise if this was not the case and why ENA is the entity purchasing the equipment in this deal. Has accounting and the originator agreed on the accounting treatment this transaction will receive based on the sale process/flow of $$ described below? Notice of Intent to Purchase: 1. Since CA Development was completed, the form of the Notice has been changed to be more detailed with respect to the underlying financing: This letter will serve as written notice to the Administrative Agent that (1) the Development and Construction Manager under the Development and Construction Management Agreement dated as of December 15, 2000, among E-Next Generation LLC, the Developer Subsidiaries from time to time parties thereto, and Enron North America Corp., as Development and Construction Manager (as such terms are define in such agreement), has designated [name of purchaser and state of incorpation], as its designee pursuant to Section 6.1(a) of such Development and Construction Management Agreement, and (2) [purchaser] intends to purchase the Specified Option Property listed (and as defined) in Exhibit 1 attached hereto. The applicable purchase date shall be [insert date]. The Notice should be signed by ENA with Consent provided by Salmon Energy LLC as purchaser. These documents in draft form should be approved by CSFB/Milbank prior to us sending the Notice. When the Notice is sent, the execution copies of all documents associated with the purchase should also be sent to the appropriate parties. Sending one package is the most expedient method and most likely to have the documents executed in the five business days that we need. Rose Engeldorf can provide you with the information you need for whom to send it to. Exhibit 1 to Notice to Purchase: As noted above, item 5 can be deleted in this Notice. In item 6, please spell out the parties involved in the Agreement in Principle as ""the foregoing parties"" can be interpreted to include WestLB as stated in the May 12, 2000 turbine purchase agreement. As we all know, they are not a party to the Ag in Principle. Also, Kay had been talking with Rose about perhaps changing the AIP to become a change order to the existing LM6000 master turbine purchase agreement. Is this happening? If so, won't this change this description in every schedule to these purchase agreements? Assumption & Assumption Agreement: This Schedule 1 should mirror the Schedule 1 in the Bill of Sale. In Schedule 2, please add an attention line to Shazia Sarker, CSFB , Phone 212 325 9935. Bill of Sale: In first paragraph, please correct E-Next's name. There should not be a ""I"" at the end of it. Also, insert ""the"" before the definition of ""Developer"". Schedule 1 needs to have the same changes made as I discussed above under Notice of Intent to Purchase. UCC-3s: Not part of your package but a required document for releasing the equipment from E-Next to Salmon. Rose can help you insure that these are created. Please provide your comments to the above group along with the next draft of documents, which should probably be ready for review by CSFB/Milbank. -----Original Message----- From: Sole, Carlos Sent: Friday, April 13, 2001 11:48 AM To: Engeldorf, Roseann; Mann, Kay; Bills, Lisa; Clark, Catherine Subject: Turbopark Notices and Documents for Delta Turbine Sale In connection with the required Turbopark notices and documents related to the turbine sale to Delta, attached for your initial review and comment are drafts of the initial notice to CSFB, an assignment and assumption agreement and a bill of sale.

If the lender desires Salmon resolutions authorizing a security agreement to be signed by Salmon, we would recommend that the new Salmon board controlled by PPL sign resolutions ratifying and approving the security agreement, rather than have ENA approve a security agreement that it has not negotiated and is not familiar with. From a timing standpoint, we need to focus on the documentation required to set up the escrow account, as I understand that the escrow may be funded on the same day as the financial closing, namely, Thursday, April 19.

I believe that this is the total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project. Ben is planning to talk with Lee at GE. I talked with Panda this morning. They do not have a fixed close date. They are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of signing the Letter Agreement. I believe that this is doable. Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates. He is working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not yet assigned serial #'s to the units). What price are we assigning to the LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement? Let's stay consistent with that document. The person who will be signing for Panda is Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President. The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement. The balance of the purchase price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing. Is this the pricing information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont? Ben: We need to talk re: the transformers. We quoted Panda $950K per unit for the two transformers. It is not clear if the transformers will work for Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration. If we are re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at LV Co-Gen? Kathleen: I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's. I will let you know when I hear back from him.

However, the breakout contract is for all the LV Co Gen units, but that is easy enough to fix. Does GE know this is coming? What are you projecting for a closing date? We need the unit numbers (original and serial), associated delivery dates, price attributable to the units (maximum liability amount), price to sell the LLC member interests, and the contact persons from Panda for the contract. Will there be a development fee, and if so, how much? If you get me the particulars of the deal we can work on it in house. We have the forms, so we can get cracking without outside counsel. In fact, I've been working on the form letter agreement today in connection with the other deal. Retaining outside counsel requires internal approval, which I'm sure we can get in the next day or two, assuming no conflict of interest. I can get started on the process if you are ready. If you think these guys are serious, we can set up the LLC's. We may want two LLC's if the total price is in excess of $50mm. Kathleen, please talk to me before we do this as I think we should discuss the slate of officers.

I requested copies of the note, security agreement and the non-disturbance lien document. She said they will be using a securities account with a securities intermediary structure (UCC Article 8 concept) rather than a non-disturbance lien. She said they are working on these documents and will furnish as soon as possible. 2. I advised that the ENA consent is satisfactory. 3. I advised of the timing issue on the GE consent, such that the GE acknowledgement of payment needed to be prospective due to logistical issues. She is considering this. 4. She requested a quick response on whether the GE letter agreement is consistent with Enron's discussions with GE, as she needs to get this to GE as soon as possible in order that they will be ready to sign it on Friday 4/20. The GE letter agreement (agreeing to the form of all of the documents) must be signed this Friday 4/20 before the lenders will advance funds, as this letter agreement is a condition precedent to funding. Please advise on this issue. I also spoke with Greg Lang and expect comments on the Escrow Agreement within a half hour or so. I reminded him of the need for a W-9 and an incumbency certificate to open the escrow account. (Estelle Lawrence has also called looking for the escrow agreement). Carolyn M.

Per the letter agreement, we already have agreement on the form of Amended and Restated LLC Agreement; however, the outstanding issue with respect to requiring unanimous member consent for sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the LLC is still on the table. Isabel Parker called and reminded me that the ENA Consent and Agreement is to be signed tomorrow, Friday 4/20, contemporaneously with the funding of the escrow account, rather than upon closing. She is happy with the letter if we drop its references to the ENA Consent and Agreement. I am now worried about the ability to have an escrow funded by tomorrow, given that we still haven't let the escrow agent in on this structure.

We also need to make sure a mechanism in place that ensures that upon Pegasus' payment of the $800 on the morning of the transaction closing (post-Turbine K execution and pre-escrow release), ENA will deliver the membership interest in Salmon and any other deliverable required to allow the Delta/Pegasus slate of officers to be installed to execute the Salmon Note and the Salmon Security Agreement.

Based on our meeting, Carolyn was going to make certain revisions based on the answers to the questions below and certain other items we raised during our meeting. Nevertheless, your input is required on the following: 1. We have discussed eliminating the payment of a development fee, which if Delta / Panda were to breach its obligations prior to the funding of the Escrow would be non-refundable and serve as a form of liquidated damages. Commercially the inclination is to avoid that fee, we need to confirm that approach. 2. We need to interface with Dale Rasmussen on the status of the break out contract and how quickly it can be incorporated into the form of Facility Agreement that would be part of our transaction. 3. Have we established an LLC that will be sold for this project. 4. Please see Caroline's questions 6, 7 and 13 below. 5. Please see faxes that I left on your chair on the broker issue and whether we need to respond in writing. Sheila Tweed's position was not to. 6. John asked whether K&S should open a separate subfile or include the time charged within the Blue Dog file?

Entitlement Letter Agreement; 4. ENA Consent and Agreement; 5. Consent of Sole Member authorizing the turbine acquisition and the issuance of membership interests; 6. First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (we will fill in the dates later); and 7. Consent of Members of LLC electing new directors, and Consent of Directors of LLC electing new officers (we will type in names once they are provided by Pegasus). You should have the following documents: 1. Schedule of Fees for Escrow Agreement; and 2. Certificate of Incumbency; 3. Assignment and Assumption Agreement; 4. Bill of Sale; and 5. Notice of Intent to Purchase Specified Option Property. The following agreements are not yet available for signature by ENA: 1. Escrow Disbursement Instructions (Greg says he thinks the one we originally submitted was okay, but he wants to review again - he had put it on hold due to the securities entitlement account issue) 2. LLC Membership Certificates (need membership certificate books) 3. Secretary's Certificate of LLC (waiting on revised draft from Paul Hastings - they have promised to re-send it shortly. If I don't get this in an hour or so, I'll have my secretary re-type it and will forward to you. Unfortunately, this one is the other incumbency certificate which requires a number of signatures). I have convinced Greg Lang that since the GE Consent and Agreement refers to the fact that Salmon LLC has granted a security interest in the Turbine Contract to the lenders, the GE Consent and Agreement should be executed by Salmon after Pegasus is in control of Salmon. Therefore, I have not enclosed the GE Consent and Agreement in this package. Please send over a signed copy of the Confidentiality Agreement for our records. If you have any questions or comments, please advise. Thanks. Carolyn M.

The Connecticut courts and the Freedom of Information Commission (the ""FOIC""), the agency charged with the enforcement of FOIA, have repeatedly held that CRRA, CDA and DECD are public agencies within the purview of FOIA (I have not had time to consider whether the same is true for DEP, CPUC and the other attendees, but suspect that it is so with respect to certain of them). FOIA provides, among other things, that all documents obtained or kept by a public agency are public records available to the public, unless otherwise exempted from disclosure by special statute or by the exemptions delineated by FOIA. While there is no special statute with regard to CRRA, a special statute, Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 32-11a(k), exempts certain materials and information submitted to DECD and to CDA from public disclosure. Section 32-11a(k) states that all information contained in any application for financial assistance submitted to DECD or CDA, and all information obtained by the DECD or CDA with respect to any person or project is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. The statute specifies that this exemption includes all financial, credit and proprietary information. I have not had time to consider whether there are special statutory exemptions provided for similar information submitted to the other attendees. Consequently, FOIA governs the confidentiality of all information submitted to CRRA and, perhaps, certain of the other attendees and the confidentiality of information submitted to DECD and CDA falling outside Section 32-11a(k)'s exemption. As may be pertinent in these circumstances, FOIA exempts from disclosure: (1) preliminary drafts under certain circumstances, (2) trade secrets and commercial or financial information given in confidence, and that is not required by statute to be disclosed to an agency, (3) real estate appraisals, engineering or feasiblity estimates or evaluations for an agency relative to the acquisition of property or to prospective public supply and construction contracts, but only until such time as the property is acquired or the transaction abandoned, (4) tax returns, reports and statements exempted by federal law or state statutes, and (5) communications privileged by the attorney-client relationship. While the Connecticut courts and FOIC have held that the confidentiality of information submitted to agencies subject to FOIA is determined by applicable law rather that the representations or agreements of the parties, they have suggested that measures designed to preserve confidentiality may be considered in making that determination. While your notice cites a May 19, 2000 Agreement of Confidentiality previously executed by CRRA and Enron (which I have not seen), obviously that will not be binding upon any attendees not a party to it and, while it would be better to have the other attendees execute a written agreement regarding confidentiality, I understand that that may not be practical given the timing and the number of parties involved. Accordingly, I recommend that the following other steps be employed with respect to confidential information submitted to the attendees: 1. All documents and information submitted to the attendees should be marked ""Preliminary Draft"". 2. In the fourth paragraph of your notice, change clause (1) to read ""the Subject Information is being provided to it in confidence, contains trade secrets and/or confidential commercial, financial and proprietary information and other information exempt from disclosure under certain laws of the State of Connecticut, and it will maintain the confidentiality of the Subject Information"". 3. You should take steps, internally, to ensure the confidentiality of the information you submit to the agencies. Appropriate measures would include: (a) limiting access to confidential information to a ""need to know"" basis, (b) entering into confidentiality agreements with others involved in the project with respect to their studies, analyses, etc., for the project, (c) advising your personnel (secretarial, etc.), in writing, that the information is confidential and of the need to maintain such information in confidence, and (d) maintaining confidential information in locked or otherwise private files. 5. A request should be made by you to the agencies that confidential information be discussed by the agencies in executive session. If we take these measures with regard to information supplied to the agencies, we will enhance the likelihood of maintaining the confidentiality of the information in response to a public request for disclosure of the information pursuant to the FOIA. Should you wish to discuss this matter in more detail, please do not hesitate to call me at (860) 240-2943. -----Original Message----- From: Barton Clark [mailto:Barton.Clark@enron.com] Sent: Monday, August 28, 2000 4:07 PM To: Heather Kroll Cc: silverbc@bingham.com Subject: Presentation I suggest adding the attached in as the first page of text in the presentation materials and call the attendee's attention to it at the commencement of the presentation.

Candidly, I don't see how Murtha can continue to represent us in lobbying for the subject transactions and represent CRRA in lobbying and legal representation for the same transactions without conflicts or creating the appearance of impropriety, and the markup reflects that scepticism by trying to segregate out the representation cleanly. Also, to the extent the original draft indicated Murtha had represented both CRRA and Enron re the transactions until now, we need to make sure that we are OK with waiving that conflict as a substantive matter. I'm not familiar enough with the representation to know if Enron's interests could have been compromised during that period of dual representation, and I do not think we should agree to the waiver until we are comfortable on that score.The letter also now makes clear that Murtha will not be able to represent either party or their affiliates in litigation involving them. Since the letter requires the signature of Enron Corp., I'm trying to find out what clearance is required, as I customarily do not review or initial Corp. documents for signature. "

If we can't execute the EPC Contracts by this time or for the funds which are for activities outside of construction (i.e., development, major maintenance reserve...etc.), Jeff will probably want to execute a separate escrow or financial contract where we get to manage those funds and take some form of return (also supported with some form of corporate guarantee for unused funds).

Press Releases-the press release has not yet been prepared, but a first draft was worked up by FCEL's consel. Cle Dade and I are going to look at it with respect to what we think it should say, but have not yet done so. 2.Term Sheet -I will send you a draft of the most recent term sheet I am aware of by separate email..I believe they are in discussions with FCEL on that draft, but nothing has been signed. 3.Disclosure Discussions-I will also send you under separate email the initial draft of the ""talking points"" for the disclosure discusison. It is new and has not been discussed internally yet. 4.Contracts-Initial drafts of the documents for the purchase of the equity have been drafted and we await comments from FCEL's counsel. Kay Mann is handling the ""State"" side of the deal and I request Kay by copy of this memo to advise you on what the status of any dealings with the state might be. 5.Regulatory Filings-There will be no filings required with respect to the purchase of the equity, unless we have to file a Sched. 13D, which will depend upon the timing of the option vesting. My gut reaction is that we will probably need to file the 13D, but it is a routine filing. I do not know what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and again request Kay to please advise us on that. It seems to me thay we should get a little farther along before we meet with the team on this, but I defer to your judgment. Let me know what you want to do.

FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that vest based upon 60MW of orders; - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on that call; - the transaction is fully press released immediately. CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW; - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in FCEL. I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory filings. I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner. Thanks Delainey "

Section 2.1 (d)--Shouldn't it just say ""highway"" as opposed to ""major highway""? 4. Section 2--Need to add the following concept. 90 days after RTO, Purchaser shall identify up to [5] primary or alternative sites for installation of the units (identification to include an expected configuration). Upon 10 day notice, Purchaser shall have the right to substitute sites or change site configurations. The project plans shall be based on the primary configurations identified by Purchaser. 4 months prior to shipment, Purchaser must identify the site where a unit must go. At this point, the site is locked in for that unit. 5. Section 3.3 (c)--insert ""or as reasonably required to implement"" after ""as required by"". 6. Section 3.16--Add in concept of identified sites. Timing of plans should coincide with site identification. 7.

Tomorrow a meeting is taking place with FuelCells to resolve some major outstanding business issues. At this meeting, the point is going to be made that in order to maintain the desired schedule, FCE is going to have to increase its technical effort. Presently, we are concerned that the technical aspects of the purchase order are not in sufficient order to finalize a purchase order by next week (we want to make certain that our deal with FuelCells is largely defined before we make a state filing). We are going to emphasize to FCE that both sides need to devote their technical resources to this goal. One of our priorities is to bring the technical portions of the purchase order up to the level necessary to finalize an order. I need the Tony Leo list today so I can show FuelCells all the information that they owe us before this meeting. 2. We have redrafted the purchase order. However, the P.O. needs refinement to reflect the resolution of the outstanding business terms and to make certain that the technical information and procedures are clearly defined (much of the information that I sent you). Given 1) the proposed payment mechanics and 2) FCE's lack of mature documents, we are concerned that FCE will try to get by with loose technical language to avoid acceptance and ultimately payment issues. Also, we are concerned that once we make our state filing that our negotiating leverage with FCE will go down. One of our major focuses jobs between now and 11/3/00 is to make certain that the technical sections of the P.O. are properly defined. 3. With regard to the BOP cost estimates, I would like to get the revised estimates no later than tomorrow. Our current plan is to make a state filing (CRRA will make the filing and the filing will be the source of the funding) which clearly defines our basic assumptions in coming up with these estimates (we will not show the complete estimates) and to show conservative ranges. You will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the cost and technical information provided in the filing. A draft of the filing is to be sent to CRRA by 11/3. Given this approach, it is less important that we go to the sites next week. Our focus should be on getting the purchase order into shape (from a technical point of view) and making sure that the state filing is accurate as to our base technical assumptions. 4. The state filing is expected to be made by CRRA in the subsequent week. Please give me a call if you have any questions."

Estimating does not agree with this reduced contingency and I feel it is inadequate for the level of detail provided. 2. Because of this reduction in contingency, I have re-evaluated the concrete account and moved the Slab on Grade from the FCE Scope to the EE&CC Scope of Work. I have also revised the foundations for FCE based on the quantities they provided. 3. We are using $10,000 per cell for Grounding Grid based on reviewing additional estimating data. (The earlier number of $75,000 for the first two (2) cells and $25,000 for each additional cell was provided as an estimate from FCE. We agree it is too high. 4.

Those specifications will be subject to change, except the items listed in Exhibit C (Fixed Specifications) which will not be subject to change. In the P.O., there will be an initial permitting period during which, we can cancel the P.O. at no cost if FCE does make additions to Exhibit C as needed to lock in the permit filings (we will also propose changes to the Performance Standards if we reasonably believe that we can not permit the Performance Standards set forth in the P.O.). Also, attached to the P.O. will be a typical unit site layout. On this layout, it will identify our various points of interconnection between our scope of work and FCE's. These interconnection points will be contractually fixed and not subject to change. During our permitting effort, we will provide FCE will a site layout for each facility (using the standard unit layout). FCE will only approve the layout as to access. Eight months after release of the order, FCE will provide us with the engineering drawings used to bid out FCE's scope of work. We will have two weeks to review and approve. Twelve months after release of the order, FCE will provide us with the final specs which will be based on the engineering drawings. I need you all to do the following: 1.

It would fall under exhibit D, together with the other two categories of performance testing already discussed and agreed to with FCE (Acceptance Performance Testing and Warrantee Compliance Performance Testing). As a third category of performance testing, the replacement stack testing will be subject to all of the requirements that have been set forth for the other performance testing...mainly the need for an agreed to procedure. Please let me know if you have nay comments, or if we need to have more or less details in the paragraph. Replacement Stack Testing: Replacement Stack Performance Testing will be done following the replacement of one or both stacks on each unit. The replacement stack performance testing shall be performed to asses the new stack performance level and to determine its contribution to the overall plant. Replacement stack testing must include provisions to accurately determine stack performance and its contribution to the overall plant performance. It includes detail evaluation of the DC to AC conversion performance in order to be able to express the new stack performance level in terms of plant net output and efficiency.

We had offered a 15% reduction in efficiency in our warranty. When we changed efficiency to heat rate, we neglected to correct the percentage change because heat rate goes up as efficiency declines. Mathematically, there is an inverse relationship (see attached spreadsheet) which means that the equivalent of a 15% reduction in efficiency is an 18% increase in heat rate. Therefore we propose to change the Heat Rate reduction in the first sentence of Section 14.3 (also attached) from 15% to 18% and correspondingly revise the total change from 20% to 23%. <<14.3 revision.doc>> <<eff and heat rate.xls>> Ross M.

The Repalcement Stack Test is missing from that document. I am attaching Tony's draft of it. (Previously sent to you.) Replacement Stack Testing: Replacement Stack Performance Testing will be done following the replacement of one or both stacks on each unit. The replacement stack performance testing shall be performed to asses the new stack performance level and to determine its contribution to the overall plant. Replacement stack testing must include provisions to accurately determine stack performance and its contribution to the overall plant performance. It includes detail evaluation of the DC to AC conversion performance in order to be able to express the new stack performance level in terms of plant net output and efficiency. Exhibit C - Comment A major Concern is the Correction Factor for thermal cycles! This seems to be a steep correction, 1% for each cycle above 2 per year. This would suggest is any type of cycling is done on the plant, the repalcement stack could be needed as early as 1 to 2 years. Please call to discuss Exhibit C - Clarifications and Comments Section C.1 1. Confirm Exhaust Stack height and/or diameter does not influence guarantee up to 40ft. This is within FCE scope of supply. 2. Confirm the stack contains EPA test ports and platform/ladders for access. Section C.3 1. Include drawing number and revision Section C.4 1. Basis Conditions and Performance Correction Factors Should read ""Basis Conditions"" Table C.2 Site Basis Conditions 1. Elevation above Sea Level Should be Ambient Barometric Pressure, psia, 14.69 2. Footnote for wind loading indicates 30 psf, design states 24 psf. Should basis also state 30 psf? Or change to wind speed rather than load: -- seems design basis should be wind speed (90 mph) and contractor has responsibility for design interpretation of the UBC. -- refer to UBC chapter 23, part II - Wind Design -- identify Importance Factor, I, equal to 1.0 (or 1.15, as the civil design requires). 3. Ambient dust loading on an annual average basis does not seem meaningful for performance considerations. Use a 3-hour value? 4. Same comment for Ambient gaseous halide concentration -- Have never seen reference to halides as a design basis. Please explain. 5. Note 1 does not seem to belong to Table C.2. Relocate? Table C.3 Fuel Compostion Range - Clarify the impact if the gas is above these levels. 1. COS 2. 0.7 grain/100 SCF is max total sulfur 3. Same with water of 7 lb/MMscf. 4. Odorants C.5 Correction Factors 1. Is this paragraph necessary? C.5.1) Table C.4 1. Correction factor alpha-T should be 0.84+.002*T if the factor is to be 1.0 at T=80. C.5.2) Elevation 1. Change to barometric pressure. This is the measureable quantity. Will only correct for barometric pressure. 2. Presents an equation for Max. Unit Output in terms of barometric pressure where the term aH is introduced. This term should be aP. 3. Presents an equation for the correction factor aP. The existing equation is: aP = 1.17 - P x 0.0015 Please confirm the equation should be: aP = 1.017 - P x 0.00015 C.5.5) Operating History 1. Clarify the definition of new-and-clean. 2. Any thermal cycles occuring during startup and commissioning and testing by the contractor do not count? 3. Is there any consideration under which degradation is applied at the original acceptance test? Terri Austin "

The agreement does not appear to have any ""fatal flaws"" with respect to enforceability under Connecticut law. There are no liquidated damages provisions or ""sole"" remedy provisions that are often times problematic. The contract does contain a rather extensive force majeure provision which we have not fully analyzed under Connecticut law, but the provision appears to be reasonably drafted and should not be a problem. If you would like, we can take a closer look at it for precedents under Connecticut law. As to the granting of the security interest and the filing of financing statements, we think that these provisions are reasonable for this type of contract and merely provide the seller with a mechanism for perfecting its security interest.
